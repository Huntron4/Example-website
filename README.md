## Documentation
Web page, mainly created to fulfill creative task from university class. 
### Goal
The goal was to perform *website creator* and *designer* skills and to prove knowledge of **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaSript** languages.  
Task assignment was highly open -> only technical requirements were set (*forbidden to use any framework , required support for  some display resolutions, responsibility of webpage, etc.*), so the theme and design is product purely of website creator.

### Quality 
Due to other university projects and obligations, this web page was created in approximately 5 days. This took credit on code quality - CSS is not really clear to read and is not commented enough. A lot of display ratios are not supported (not requested for task) so the experience for those may be poor. 

## Files
- index.html
- style.css 
- script.js 
- ./images folder

#### HTML
The `index.html` file contains base of website. Define its **structure** and **content**. Texts, pictures, references and other needed structure divisions.

#### CSS
The *cascading style sheet* file  `style.css` contains **style rules** that are applied to **HTML** file. Defines looks of different sections, pictures, themes and a bit of dynamics used on scale of elements. (*picture effects, text decorations, etc.*).

#### JavaScript
The `script.js` file contains opening initialization "*on load*" of page. And then distributes work to other functions to ensure page dynamics to work. Functions allways creates support for one of the section displayed on page. (Alternatively creates **easter egg** in other part of page) Or is tied with some referrence/button on the page
